If not, create a new Markdown (not RMarkdown) document named README.md. Use markdown syntax to create a header that contains your repository name and a brief description in plain text.\nThe README file will show up on the home page of your repository on GitHub!\n\n\n\nStep 3.2: Stage Files\n\nOption 1 (Using the Git Pane)\n\nSelect the files you want to stage by selecting them.\nYou will see symbols beside them - “A” stands for “Added” and “M” stands for “modified”. If you were to delete a file, you would see a red “D”.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2 (Using the Terminal)\n\nRun git add .. This will stage all of your modified files\nYou can also just name the files you want to commit instead of using .\n\n\nStep 3.3: Commit Changes (save a snapshot of your work!)\n\nOption 1 (Using the Git Pane)\n\nClick the Commit button.\nAdd a message explaining the changes\nClick Commit. Close this pop-up.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2 (Using the Terminal)\n\nRun git commit -m \"[desciption]\" where [description] is a brief summary of the changes.\n\n\nStep 3.4: Push the Changes to GitHub\n\nOption 1 (Using the Git Pane)\n\nClick the Push button\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2 (Using the Terminal)\n\nRun git push origin &lt;branchname&gt; in the Terminal\n\n&lt;branchname&gt; is typically main or master. You find the branch name in the Git pane or by using git status\nIn my example, I would run git push origin main\n\n\n\n\nAfter pushing, you should be able to see the updates on your GitHub repository!\n\nNotice the message beside your changed files - those are your commit messages!"

    "text": "Part 5: Cloning\n“Cloning” refers to the process of taking an existing repository on GitHub and making a copy on your local computer.\nSome tutorials will refer to this as a “GitHub First” approach to syncing your changes to GitHub.\nStep 5.1: Copy link to repository\n\nNavigate to the repository you want to clone on GitHub.\nClicking the green “Code” button to copy the address of the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.2: Clone the Repository\n\nIn RStudio, go to “File &gt; New Project”\nClick on “Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository”\nClick on “Git: Clone a project from a repository”\nFill in the details:\n\nURL: use the HTTPS address (from Step 5.1)\nCreate as a subdirectory of: Browse to where you would like to save this repository on your machine (creates a new folder in the location you select)\n\n\n\nNow you have a local version of this project!\nIf you have permission to, you can push and pull the same as in Part 4!\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note:\n\nYou can clone any public project, however you need to be added as a collaborator to push those changes to GitHub.\nIf you’d like to play around with existing repositories, you could “Fork” it. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
