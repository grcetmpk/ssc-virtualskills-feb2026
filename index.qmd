## Workshop Details 

In this workshop, we will learn how to set up Git on RStudio, and
connect our projects to GitHub confidently. Specifically, we will learn
how to:

-   Initialize Git in RStudio,

-   Connect our R Projects with Git

-   Synchronize our local projects to GitHub (R project first)

-   Clone a project that exists on GitHub to RStudio (GitHub first)

-   Stage, Commit, and Push local changes using command line or
    RStudio’s built in Git panel, and

-   Pull changes from GitHub to your local project.

This workshop was designed for R coders with no prior experience with
Git’s version control system.
