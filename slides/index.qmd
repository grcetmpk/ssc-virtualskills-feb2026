## Welcome!

Welcome to today's SSC Virtual Skills Workshop.

I'm Grace! I'm a;

-   Recent Biostatistics PhD graduate (University of Waterloo, 2025)

-   New Assistant Professor of Teaching (UBC, July 2025)

-   Person who suffered greatly trying to learn how to use GitHub 🫠

## What is your experience with Git/GitHub?

Let me know in the chat! Some possible answers:

-   I use it confidently all of the time

-   I use it but it scares me

-   I tried to use it once or twice

-   I've never used it

-   I've never even heard of it

## Git

-   A free, open source version control system designed to track changes

-   Creates "snapshots" of your work as your progress through a project

## GitHub

-   Cloud-based platform for storing, managing, and collaborating

-   Uses Git (hence the name)!

## Before We Start the Demo....

-   You can follow along live (two screens/devices recommended), or watch and set up your own accounts later.

-   I have accompanying YouTube videos covering every single step, so if you miss something, you can refer back to it.

-   I have course notes from a class at UBC that had a section on GitHub that you are welcome to reference!

## Demo

In this workshop, we will do the following:

-   Set up Git on RStudio

-   Connect RStudio to GitHub

-   Connect an existing R Project to GitHub ("R First")

    -   Make changes locally and on GitHub, and sync them

-   Clone a GitHub repository to R Studio ("GitHub First")

    -   Make changes locally and on GitHub, and sync them

-   Create READMEs

-   (If time permits) Explore the use of branches

# Part 1: Set Up

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.1: [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)**

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.2: Install Git**

-   For Mac OS, on the Terminal (Mac) type `which git`. For Windows, go to Command Prompt and type `where git`. If you get an error of `git: command not found`, you do not have git installed yet. To install:

    -   **Windows:**

        -   Install Git for Windows (<https://gitforwindows.org/>)

        -   When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, keep the defaults.

    -   **Mac OS:**

        -   Install XCode Command Line Tools by opening Terminal and typing `xcode-select --install` (more info [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/))

        -   In Terminal, enter `git config`. Click install.

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.3: Configure Git in R**

-   Within the Terminal (Mac) or Shell (Windows) (Tools \> Terminal/Shell) do

    -   `git config --global user.name "your_github_username"`

    -   `git config --global user.email "your_email_you_used_for_github@example.com"`

(If you are having issues, you could use the `usethis` package in R. [See here.](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html))

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.4: Configure Your Personal Access Token (PAT)**

-   **Option 1**: Go to to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and click “Generate token”.

    -   Choose Classic Token

    -   Describe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “Stat545Installation”

    -   [Select “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” for scopes]{.underline}

    -   Set an expiry date (can regenerate tokens later)

    -   [**Save this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager**]{.underline}

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.4: Configure Your Personal Access Token (PAT) (con't)**

-   **Option 2:** From R, execute `usethis::create_github_token()` in the Console (you may have to install the usethis package first by first running `install.packages("usethis")`).

    -   Describe the token’s purpose in the Note field

    -   Set an expiry date (can regenerate tokens later)

    -   [**Save this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager**]{.underline}

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.4: Configure Your Personal Access Token (PAT) (con't)**

Regardless of how you generated your PAT, you now need to:

-   Run `install.packages("gitcreds")` in the Console

-   Run `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` and enter the PAT that you just made when prompted

# Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project ("R First")

## Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project

**Step 2.1: Initialize Git**

-   Load in the `usethis` package by calling `library(usethis)` in the Console.

-   Then, run `use_git()`.

-   When asked to commit changes, select the option that means yes. Restart RStudio if needed.

You should now see a "Git" pane by your Environment/History/Connections.

## Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project

**Step 2.2: Create a GitHub Repository for an Existing Project**

-   Run `library(usethis)` in the Console

-   Then, in the Console run `use_github()`.

-   A new repository on your GitHub account with the same name as your R Project should be created! Head to your GitHub account to check it out.

# Part 3: Connect RStudio to an Existing GitHub Repository ("GitHub First"/"Cloning")

## Part 3: Connect RStudio to an Existing GitHub Repository

**Step 3.1: Copy link to repository**

-   Navigate to the repository you want to clone on GitHub.
-   Clicking the green “Code” button to copy the address of the repository.

![](images/greenbutton.png){fig-align="center"}

## Part 3: Connect RStudio to an Existing GitHub Repository

**Step 3.2: Clone the Repository**

-   In RStudio, go to “File \> New Project”

-   Click on “Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository”

-   Click on “Git: Clone a project from a repository”

-   Fill in the details:

    -   URL: use the HTTPS address (from Step 3.1)

    -   Create as a subdirectory of: Browse to where you would like to save this repository on your machine (creates a new folder in the location you select)

Now you have a local version of this project!

**ADD IMAGE OF DEMO PROJECT**

## Part 3: Connect RStudio to an Existing GitHub Repository

*Side note:*

-   *You can clone any public project, however you need to be added as a collaborator to push those changes to GitHub.*

-   *If you’d like to play around with existing repositories, you could “Fork” it. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. More info here: <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo>.*

# Part 4: Sync Changes from your Computer

To use Git, we should first understand the primary states that files can be in. These are:

-   **Modified**: you’ve changed something in the files, but Git hasn’t accounted for them yet.

-   **Staged**: Git has tracked the changes you’ve made, but they haven’t been accounted for in the latest snapshot of your work.

-   **Committed**: the changes you’ve made have been stored and updated as the latest snapshot of your project.

After changes are committed locally (on your computer), we can **push** them to a GitHub repository. This sends the changes and updates the most recent version of your project on GitHub.

# Part 4: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 4.1: Make some local changes**

-   Edit and save the changes you make to *any* file in your repository

-   In the Git pane, you will now see any files with changes listed.

# Part 4: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 4.2: Stage Files**

-   **Option 1 (Using the Git Pane)**

    -   Select the files you want to stage by selecting them.

    -   You will see symbols beside them - “A” stands for “Added” and “M” stands for “modified”. If you were to delete a file, you would see a red “D”.

-   **Option 2 (Using the Terminal)**

    -   Run `git add .`. This will stage **all** of your modified files

    -   You can also just name the files you want to commit instead of using `.`

# Part 4: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 4.2: Commit Changes (save a snapshot of your work!)**

-   **Option 1 (Using the Git Pane)**

    -   Click the Commit button.

    -   In the pop-up, you can scan through and see the changes (additions, deletions, modifications) for each file that has been staged in Step 1.

    -   Add a message explaining the changes

    -   Click Commit. Close this pop-up.

-   **Option 2 (Using the Terminal)**

    -   Run `git commit -m "[desciption]"` where \[description\] is a brief summary of the changes.

## Ways I've Used GitHub

-   Thesis/independent research projects

-   Consulting (collaborative work)

-   Teaching (all! the! time!)

-   Website Creation

-   Documenting issues on R Packages

(I even got asked about my GitHub experiences in my UBC interview!)
