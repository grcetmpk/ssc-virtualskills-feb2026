## Welcome!

Welcome to today's SSC Virtual Skills Workshop.

I'm Grace! I'm a;

-   Recent Biostatistics PhD graduate (University of Waterloo, 2025)

-   New Assistant Professor of Teaching (UBC, July 2025)

-   Person who suffered greatly trying to learn how to use GitHub 🫠

## What is your experience with Git/GitHub?

Let me know in the chat! Some possible answers:

-   🤪 I use it confidently all of the time

-   😬 I use it but it still scares me

-   🫣 I tried to use it once or twice

-   🤔 I've heard of it, but have never used it

-   🤠 I've never even heard of it

## Git

-   A free, open source version control system designed to track changes

-   Creates "snapshots" of your work as your progress through a project

## GitHub

-   Cloud-based platform for storing, managing, and collaborating

-   Uses Git (hence the name)!

## Ways I've Used GitHub

-   Thesis/independent research projects

-   Consulting (collaborative work)

-   Teaching (all! the! time!)

-   Website Creation (Quarto + GitHub Pages)

-   Documenting issues on R Packages

(I even got asked about my GitHub experiences in my UBC interview!)

## Before We Start the Demo....

-   You can follow along live (two screens/devices recommended), or watch and set up your own accounts later.

-   I have accompanying YouTube videos covering every single step, so if you miss something, you can refer back to it.

-   I have [course notes from a class I taught at UBC](https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat545/webpages/lectures_i/lec2b_versioncontrol.html) that had a lecture on GitHub that you are welcome to use/reference!

## Demo

In this workshop, we will do the following:

-   Set up Git on RStudio

-   Connect RStudio to GitHub

-   Connect an existing R Project to GitHub ("R First")

    -   Make changes locally and on GitHub, and sync them

-   Clone a GitHub repository to R Studio ("GitHub First")

    -   Make changes locally and on GitHub, and sync them

-   Create READMEs

# Part 1: Set Up

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.1: [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)**

-   I'd recommend using your personal email, not a student email.

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.2 Install Git**

-   **Windows:**

    -   Open Command Prompt and type `where git` . If you get an error, continue:

    -   Install Git for Windows (<https://gitforwindows.org/>)

    -   When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, keep the defaults.

-   **Mac OS:**

    -   On the Terminal (Mac) type `which git` . If you get an error, continue:

    -   Install XCode Command Line Tools by opening Terminal and typing `xcode-select --install` (more info [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/))

    -   In Terminal, enter `git config`. Click install.

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.3: Configure Git in R**

-   Within the Terminal (Mac) or Shell (Windows) **within RStudio** (Tools \> Terminal/Shell) do

    -   `git config --global user.name "your_github_username"`

    -   `git config --global user.email "your_email_you_used_for_github@example.com"`

(If you are having issues, you could use the `usethis` package in R. [See here.](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html))

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.4: Configure Your Personal Access Token (PAT)**

-   **Option 1**: Go to to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and click “Generate token”.

    -   Choose Classic Token

    -   Describe the token’s purpose in the Note field, e.g. “personal-macbook” or “Stat545Installation”

    -   [Select “repo”, “user”, and “workflow” for scopes]{.underline}

    -   Set an expiry date (can regenerate tokens later)

    -   [**Save this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager**]{.underline}

<center><img src="https://docs.catalyst.zoho.com/images/tutorials/githubbot/github-bot-generate-personal-access-token.webp" width="700px"/></center>

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.4: Configure Your Personal Access Token (PAT) (cont'd)**

-   **Option 2:** From R, execute `usethis::create_github_token()` in the Console (you may have to install the usethis package first by first running `install.packages("usethis")`).

    -   Describe the token’s purpose in the Note field

    -   Set an expiry date (can regenerate tokens later)

    -   [**Save this token somewhere so you can use it again later, such as a password manager**]{.underline}

## Part 1: Set Up

**Step 1.4: Configure Your Personal Access Token (PAT) (cont'd)**

Regardless of how you generated your PAT, you now need to:

-   Run `install.packages("gitcreds")` in the Console

-   Run `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` and enter the PAT that you just made when prompted

    -   Note: the password will not show up when pasted! Paste once and press enter.

# Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project 

## Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project

There are two ways that we can connect GitHub and R Projects. The first way we will show is the "R First" approach (i.e., starting with an R Project and creating a repository for it).

In Part 5, we will do the opposite and start with a GitHub repository and create a local version of it.

## Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project

**Step 2.1: Initialize Git**

-   Load in the `usethis` package by calling `library(usethis)` in the Console.

-   Then, run `use_git()`.

-   When asked to commit changes, select the option that means yes. Restart RStudio if needed.

## Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project

You should now see a "Git" pane by your Environment/History/Connections.

![](images/gittab.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

## Part 2: Connect GitHub to an Existing R Project

**Step 2.2: Create a GitHub Repository for an Existing Project**

-   Run `library(usethis)` in the Console

-   Then, in the Console run `use_github()`.

-   A new repository on your GitHub account with the same name as your R Project should be created! Head to your GitHub account to check it out.

# Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

To use Git, we should first understand the primary states that files can be in. These are:

-   **Modified**: you’ve changed something in the files, but Git hasn’t accounted for them yet.

-   **Staged**: Git has tracked the changes you’ve made, but they haven’t been accounted for in the latest snapshot of your work.

-   **Committed**: the changes you’ve made have been stored and updated as the latest snapshot of your project.

After changes are committed locally (on your computer), we can **push** them to a GitHub repository. This sends the changes and updates the most recent version of your project on GitHub.

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.1: Make some local changes**

-   Edit and save the changes you make to *any* file in your repository

    -   *Do you have a README file yet? If not, create a new Markdown (not RMarkdown) document named README.md. Use markdown syntax to create a header that contains your repository name and a brief description in plain text.*

    -   *The README file will show up on the home page of your repository on GitHub!*

        ![](images/readme.png)

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.2: Stage Files**

-   **Option 1 (Using the Git Pane)**

    -   Select the files you want to stage by selecting them.

    -   You will see symbols beside them - “A” stands for “Added” and “M” stands for “modified”. If you were to delete a file, you would see a red “D”.

        ![](images/staging.png){width="600"}

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.2: Stage Files (cont'd)**

-   **Option 2 (Using the Terminal)**

    -   Run `git add .`. This will stage **all** of your modified files

    -   You can also just name the files you want to commit instead of using `.`

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.3: Commit Changes (save a snapshot of your work!)**

-   **Option 1 (Using the Git Pane)**

    -   Click the Commit button.

    -   Add a message explaining the changes

    -   Click Commit. Close this pop-up.

        ![](images/committing.png){width="700"}

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.3: Commit Changes (save a snapshot of your work, cont'd)**

-   **Option 2 (Using the Terminal)**

    -   Run `git commit -m "[desciption]"` where \[description\] is a brief summary of the changes.

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.4: Push the Changes to GitHub**

-   **Option 1 (Using the Git Pane)**

    -   Click the Push button

        ![](images/push.png){width="700"}

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

**Step 3.4: Push the Changes to GitHub (cont'd)**

-   **Option 2 (Using the Terminal)**

    -   Run `git push origin <branchname>` in the Terminal
        -   \<branchname\> is typically `main` or `master`. You find the branch name in the Git pane or by using `git status`

        -   In my example, I would run `git push origin main`

            ![](images/branchname.png){width="700"}

## Part 3: Sync Changes from your Computer

After pushing, you should be able to see the updates on your GitHub repository!

-   Notice the message beside your changed files - those are your commit messages!

    ![](images/commitmessages.png)

# Part 4: Pull Changes from GitHub to Your Local Project

## Part 4: Pull Changes from GitHub

Perhaps you made a change directly on GitHub, or a collaborator pushed changes to Github

These changes are not automatically shown on your local version of your R Project

You need to **pull** these changes from GitHub to your local version

![](images/editdirectly.png){fig-align="center"}

## Part 4: Pull Changes from GitHub

**Step 4.1: Pull**

-   **Option 1 (Using the Git Pane)**

    -   Click the Push button

        ![](images/pull.png){width="700"}

        ![](images/pullresults.png){width="700"}

## Part 4: Pull Changes from GitHub

**Step 4.1: Pull**

-   **Option 2 (Using the Terminal)**

    -   Run `git pull` in the Terminal

# Part 5: Cloning

## Part 5: Cloning

"Cloning" refers to the process of taking an existing repository on GitHub and making a copy on your local computer.

Some tutorials will refer to this as a "GitHub First" approach to syncing your changes to GitHub.

## Part 5: Cloning

**Step 5.1: Copy link to repository**

-   Navigate to the repository you want to clone on GitHub.
-   Clicking the green “Code” button to copy the address of the repository.

![](images/greenbutton.png){fig-align="center"}

## Part 5: Cloning

**Step 5.2: Clone the Repository**

-   In RStudio, go to “File \> New Project”

-   Click on “Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository”

-   Click on “Git: Clone a project from a repository”

-   Fill in the details:

    -   URL: use the HTTPS address (from Step 5.1)

    -   Create as a subdirectory of: Browse to where you would like to save this repository on your machine (creates a new folder in the location you select)

        ![](images/clonewizard.png){width="700"}

## Part 5: Cloning

Now you have a local version of this project!

If you have permission to, you can push and pull the same as in Part 4!

![](images/cloningresults.png){fig-align="center"}

## Part 5: Cloning

*Side note:*

-   *You can clone any public project, however you need to be added as a collaborator to push those changes to GitHub.*

-   *If you’d like to play around with existing repositories, you could “Fork” it. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. More info here: <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo>.*
